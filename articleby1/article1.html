        <h1>Cause of Fish Mortality in the Plissa River in Zhodino City</h1>
        <div class="images">

        <p class="text">Dead fish in the Plissa River in Zhodino were discovered on January 1st by fishermen. They began to catch dead carp, carp, perch, and roach through holes and cracks formed in the ice. An underwater camera also confirmed that there was fish die-off in the reservoir formed by the river near the thermal power plant. Dead fish floated to the surface and even began to sink to the bottom. Both large specimens and "small fry" perished.</p>
        <p class="text">Representatives of the Smolevichsky District Inspectorate for Natural Resources and Environmental Protection were called to determine the cause of the fish kill. They took water samples.</p>
        <p class="text">In a video published by a local resident, it is said that express tests were conducted and indicators are given. We can assume that these are indicators of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). If so, the indicators of 3 near the dam and 3.2 near the thermal power plant indicate pollution of the river. It is worth noting that the highest pollution indicator is precisely near the thermal power plant.</p>
        <p class="text">Unfortunately, the Plissa River is one of the most polluted rivers in Belarus. According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, in terms of pollution in 2020, it was second only to the Svisloch River near the village of Korolishchevichi near Minsk and Loshitsa, which is also near Minsk.</p>
        <p class="text">The events of the first days of the new year showed that the problem of pollution of the Berezina River tributary has not disappeared. However, rare red book plants, rich river, and ichthyofauna can still be found on the river bank. But if the pollution of the Plissa is not stopped, it may repeat the fate of its younger sister, the Zhodinka River, which has practically disappeared as a living watercourse today.</p>
